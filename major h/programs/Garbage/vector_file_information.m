% our saples and test are saved in file called vectors
% to open the features    -> load vectors
% two vectors are saved
% feature      is a vector of all sample data at present 15 of each digit i.t. total 150 samples
% size of feature is 150 x 37 where 36 is features and 37 is bit itself.
% test_x is a file for features of digit x i.e. test_0, test_1 etc.
% in this test_x a vector of features of specific test digit is calculated in the form of test_feat_x where x is digit
% at present the size of test_feat_x is 10 x 37 , where 36 are density features and 37 is the digit itself.
